## My shell scripts

- [Shell Colors Library](https://github.com/omgMerrickD/scripts/blob/master/term_colors.lib) A very basic library for the Linux command line to make it a little easier to set colors in the terminal. Just source the library in another script and then use the variables to set text color via `echo -e`.

- [Wallpaper Setter](https://github.com/omgMerrickD/scripts/blob/master/wp) A script I wrote to more easily set the background wallpaper with `wal/pywal`.
